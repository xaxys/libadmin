# libadmin

A Simple Library Management System

## 1. Reasons for this project

This project is the curriculum design of "C language course". It is written for one of my friends in WHU.

## 2. Comments and Considerations

* The enviroment I developed this project on Windows that time. So if you are Linux or macOS user, maybe you can't run this project code normally. 

* Do your homework for yourself. You can learn for reference, but it's better not to plagiarize.

## 3. Encoding format

Text is encoded with **UTF-8**, If will find error about text format. Change your code page to **UTF-8 (65001)** maybe solve it. I have already added `chcp 65001` command at the beginning of this program.

## 4. Helps

If you have any question, please pull up some issues and requests.
